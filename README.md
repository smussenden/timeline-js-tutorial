# Tutorial: building a simple interactive timeline with Timeline.js

### What am I doing here?

We're going to build an interactive timeline using the excellent [Timeline.js (website)](https://timeline.knightlab.com/) tool from the Knight Lab.  

Major news organizations like [CNN  (example)](https://www.cnn.com/2016/04/20/asia/north-korea-restaurant-defectors/index.html) and [TIME (example)](http://world.time.com/2013/12/05/nelson-mandelas-extraordinary-life-an-interactive-timeline/) use Timeline.js to tell stories that combine text, tweets, photo and video.  And by the end of this, you will be able to use it to!

In this tutorial, you'll learn to use Timeline.js to build a simple timeline of the life of rapper Kendrick Lamar.  Here it is:   

### Why am I doing this?

Timelines are great ways to tell stories that unfold over, well, time, with significant events at key points along the way. A Timeline.js is a pretty simple way to build one.    

### What will I need?

* A Google account [(Sign up)](https://accounts.google.com/SignUp?hl=en).
* Access to a computer with Internet access.
* Access to the Timeline.js site, [Timeline.knightlab.com](https://timeline.knightlab.com/).

### What do I need to know before I get started?

You may find it helpful to understand how to work with a spreadsheet in Google Sheets. But even if you don't, I believe that you will figure it out.

### The tutorial

#### Part 1: Getting Started

1. Go to [Timeline.knightlab.com](https://timeline.knightlab.com/) and click the green "Make a Timeline" button.

2. Click the blue "Get the Spreadsheet Template" button.  

3. A new window will open. Log into your Google Account.

4. Click the blue button that says "make a copy".

#### Part 2: Editing the Spreadsheet

All of the information for our timeline will be stored in this spreadsheet, which is organized into rows (the horizontal lines) and columns (the vertical lines), and each bit of information is stored in a box, also known as a "cell". Each row represents one "slide" or "date" on our timeline.

1.  Change the name of the sheet by clicking the words "Copy of Official TimelineJS3 Template" in the upper right corner.  Then type "The Life of Kendrick Lamar".

2.  Take a look at the first row.  Each "cell" in this row contains the name of the column.  Each column contains one type of information -- dates, title text, link to a picture, et cetera. **IMPORTANT: NEVER change the names of these columns. If you do, your timeline won't work!**.

3.  Rows 2, 3 and 4 (look at the numbers on the far right of the sheet) each contain examples.  We'll delete these at the end.

#### Part 3: Creating a title slide.

1.  Look for row number 5, which should be empty. This is where we'll create an introductory slide. Fill out the cells that correspond to the columns in row 5 as follows:

* **Year, Month, Day,	Time,	End Year,	End Month, End Day,	End Time,	Display Date:** *Leave all of these blank.*
* **Headline:** The Life of Kendrick Lamar
* **Text:** The winner of 12 Grammy awards, rapper Kendrick Lamar was once a straight-A student in Compton, California. He has evolved into one of the world's most celebrated musicians.

#### Part 4: Creating two timeline entries.

Now that we have a title slide, let's add some notable dates from Kendrick Lamar's life.

1.  Look for row number 6, which should be empty. This is where we'll create a slide for the day Kendrick Lamar was born. Fill out the cells that correspond to the columns in row 6 as follows:  

born June 17, 1987)

* **Year:** 1987
* **Month:** 6
* **Day:**	17
* **Time:** *Leave this blank*
* **End Year:** 1987
* **End Month:** 6
* **End Day:**	17
* **End Time:** *Leave this blank*
*	**Display Date:** *Leave this blank*
* **Headline:** Born in Compton, California
* **Text:** Kendrick Lamar was born on June 17, 1987 in Compton, California and raised there, according to Biography.com. The cover of his major label debut album -- "good kid, m.A.A.d city" -- shows Lamar as a young child.

That photo says so much about my life, and about how I was raised in Compton, and the things I've seen, just through them innocent eyes. You don't see nobody else's eyes, but you see my eyes are innocent, and tryna figure out what is goin' on."
